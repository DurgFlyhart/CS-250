1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
	
A) User needs need to taken into consideration in respect to the program you are creating. You have to look at what the final product is suppose to look like then incorporate what the user needs accordingly. You can't just build the request in the simplest way, it needs to function in conjunction with the rest of the software. User stories help you focus on the individual tasks in the grander scope of the project. Each story should work together to paint the whole picture. You should be able to move from one story to another without losing the projects concept.

2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

A) I like to think of a program as one single entity. I then break it down into smaller parts and work to get them all to synergize with each other. This means working with the most basic piece of the whole program and continually building on it while testing each individual part. If you aren't testing it continuously you can build a piece of code that is incompatible with the rest of the program. This is why you need to test each piece of code on its own and with all of the other parts together.

3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A) Through out this course communication has been one of the most important concepts. In my opinion communication is more important than any other skill for working with others. Communication can mean many different things. It can be writing good comments in your code or making sure to give clear answers to the three basic questions during a daily standup. You need to use your communications skills every day to work with you team to produce the best product you can.
